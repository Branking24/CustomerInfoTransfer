There are 4 parts to setting up this program

1. Understanding the Setup.txt

	The Setup.txt file is very important in the operation of the program. There should be 6 variable names followed by colons
	then their values. These 6 variables are 'SpreadsheetID', 'MailKey', 'ClientID', 'ClientSecret', 'SheetName', and 'GmailFolderName'.
	It's crucial to the program that these variable names remain exactly as spelled here, followed by the colon, one space, then the
	variable value. Subsequent steps will teach what these values should be.

2. Setting up Gmail account to be accessed

	Gmail does not allow a program to access it with just the email and password, so you will have to set up your account to be accessed
	by a program. To do this you will need a key that you can generate through gmail.com. The steps are as follows:
		
		* Go to gmail.com and sign in to your account
		* In the upper right hand corner, click on your profile and click "Manage your Google Account"
		* On the new screen that shows up, click the 'Security' tab on the left hand side
		* Scroll down to a box called "Signing in to Google"
		* Ensure 2-Step Verification is enabled
		* In the box labelled "Signing in to Google" click on "App Passwords"
		* A screen will appear that allows you to select an app and a device, select 'Mail' for the app, and whatever type of computer you are
			using for the device
		* Click 'Generate' on the bottom of the screen
		* A screen will appear and in a yellow box will be the Mail Key needed for the program, copy that mail key and paste it in the Setup.txt file
			next to 'MailKey: '

3. Setting up Google Sheets to be accessed

	In order to allow the program to access google sheets, you will need to enable the GoogleSheets API on your device, then get values for the
	ClientID and ClientSecret. The steps are as follows:

		* Go to console.cloud.google.com and sign in to your gmail account
		* In the top left hand corner, click the button with 3 horizontal lines and then click 'APIs & Services'
		* If you have never created a project on this screen you will have to click 'Create Project' in the top right
		* Give the project any time you would like (i.e. something like 'Customer Info Transfer')
		* On the new screen that comes up, under the search bar at the very top, click the button that says '+ ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES'
		* When the search bar appears in the middle of the screen, search for 'Google Sheets API'
		* Click on the "Google Sheets API" result that pops up
		* Click the 'Enable' button
		* The Google Sheets API screen will show up, click the 'Credentials' tab in the middle of the screen
		* Click on '+ Create Credentials' on the right side of the screen and select OAuth client ID
		* Click on "Configure Consent Screen" on the top right corner
		* On the new screen, choose 'External' as the user type and click 'Create'
		* On the next screen, enter 'CsvClient' as the App name
		* In User support email put your own email
		* You can then scroll to the very bottom and fill out Developer Contact Information
			* For the email address you can put brando3034king@gmail.com or whoever you think will be able to help with the program
		* Click 'Save and Continue', on the Scopes screen click 'Save and Continue' again, and on the next Test users screen click 'Save
			and Continue' one more time
		* On Summary screen click 'Back to Dashboard'
		* On the CsvClient dashboard scroll down to 'Test users' and click "+ ADD USERS"
		* Type in the email that accesses the google spreadsheet that you will be using and click 'SAVE'
		* Go back to the "Enabled APIs & Services" tab on the left side
		* Scroll down to the list of APIs and in the filter put 'Google Sheets API'
		* Click on the 'Google Sheets API'
		* In the top right hand corner click "CREATE CREDENTIALS"
		* Click the 'User Data' bubble and then click next
		* on the Scopes screen click 'Save and Continue' at the bottom
		* on the OAuth Client ID screen, choose Desktop app as the type and give it the name 'CsvClient' then click 'Create'
		* Click 'Done'
		* On the left hand side click the 'Credentials' tab
		* Under the OAuth 2.0 Client IDs section, click on 'CsvClient'
		* On the right hand side are the Client ID and the Client Secret, copy those and put them in the Setup.txt file next to the 
			'ClientID' variable and the 'ClientSecret' variable respectively


4. Location Setups

	The final step is to set up a few locations ids. The first you will need to set up is the SpreadsheetID. The steps are as follows:

		* On Google Sheets open the spreadsheet you wish to write to
		* in the url you will see something like 'https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/{abunchofnumbersandletters}/edit#gid=0'
		* copy the string of letters and numbers after the /d/ and before the /edit, past that into the Setup.txt at the SpreadsheetID variable

	The next thing you will need is the sheet name, you can find this at the bottom left of the open spreadsheet, write that name after the SheetName
	variable in Setup.txt

	The final variable is the GmailFolderName, you can find the folder names in your gmail account
